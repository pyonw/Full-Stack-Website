# Full-Stack-Website
Create a full stack website that tracks exercises completed by the user. 
It uses React for the front-end UI app. Also uses REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service. And use MongoDB for persistence. 
Inside the REST API it will support the CRUD operations (Create, Receive, Update, and Delete). 
The React UI will have a place for the users to create websites, edit exercises in the main homepage. 
There are simple CSS rules to make it easier for the user's to follow.
